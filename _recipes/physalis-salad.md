1. Put the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, mustard, honey and salt and pepper into a dressing shaker (an empty and clean jam jar works well) and give it a good shake to bring all the ingredients together.
2. Halve the physalis and tomatoes. Crumble up the walnuts into smaller pieces.
3. Put the rocket, tomatoes, physalis and the walnuts in a bowl. Pour over the dressing and mix it through carefully.
Add the gorgonzola at the end to avoid it falling into smaller pieces.
